\section{Cross-Domain Transfer Learning}

To further validate the effectiveness of parameter-efficient methods beyond single-environment adaptation, we conducted preliminary cross-domain transfer learning experiments. These experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach in real-world deployment scenarios where models trained in one environment must be adapted to completely different wireless conditions.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

We designed four cross-domain transfer scenarios to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of LoRA-based adaptation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Urban $\rightarrow$ Rural}: Models trained on urban environments (UMa, UMi) adapted to rural macro (RMa) conditions
\item \textbf{Rural $\rightarrow$ Urban}: RMa-trained models adapted to urban environments
\item \textbf{Indoor $\rightarrow$ Outdoor}: Indoor factory (InF) models adapted to outdoor environments
\item \textbf{Outdoor $\rightarrow$ Indoor}: Outdoor-trained models adapted to indoor factory conditions
\end{itemize}

Each base model was trained for 200k iterations on the source domain, then fine-tuned using LoRA (rank=4, 26.6k parameters) for 30k iterations on the target domain.

\subsection{Preliminary Results}

Table~\ref{tab:cross_domain} summarizes the cross-domain transfer learning performance. The results demonstrate that LoRA achieves substantial performance improvements across all domain transfer scenarios with minimal additional parameters.

\input{tables/cross_domain_table}

Key observations from the cross-domain experiments:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Consistent Effectiveness}: LoRA achieves 4.8-5.3 dB improvements across all transfer scenarios
\item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: Only 0.27\% additional parameters needed for significant adaptation
\item \textbf{Fast Convergence}: 30k iterations sufficient for effective domain adaptation
\item \textbf{Robust Performance}: Performance gains are consistent regardless of source-target domain combinations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Industry Implications}

These cross-domain results have significant implications for practical wireless system deployment:

\textbf{Rapid Deployment}: Network operators can quickly adapt existing models to new environments without extensive retraining, reducing deployment time from weeks to hours.

\textbf{Cost Efficiency}: The minimal parameter overhead (26.6k parameters) enables cost-effective model updates across diverse deployment scenarios.

\textbf{Scalability}: The consistent performance across domain transfers suggests that this approach can scale to arbitrary environment combinations in real networks.

\textbf{Edge Computing}: The small parameter footprint makes cross-domain adaptation feasible even on resource-constrained edge devices.

\subsection{Future Directions}

While these preliminary results are promising, several areas warrant further investigation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Extended Evaluation}: Comprehensive analysis across more diverse wireless environments and propagation conditions
\item \textbf{Multi-hop Transfer}: Sequential adaptation across multiple domains (e.g., Urban $\rightarrow$ Rural $\rightarrow$ Indoor)
\item \textbf{Dynamic Adaptation}: Real-time model adaptation as wireless conditions change
\item \textbf{Hybrid Approaches}: Combining LoRA with other PEFT methods for enhanced adaptation capabilities
\end{itemize}

The detailed analysis of cross-domain transfer learning, including extensive experimental validation and theoretical analysis, will be presented in subsequent research focused specifically on this aspect of parameter-efficient channel estimation.
