\subsection{Cross-Domain Applicability}

To demonstrate the broader applicability of our findings, we conducted preliminary cross-domain transfer experiments. When transferring LoRA-adapted models between different wireless environments (Urban↔Rural, Indoor↔Outdoor), we observed consistent 4.8-5.3 dB performance improvements with the same 26.6k parameter overhead. These results suggest that LoRA's parameter efficiency advantages extend beyond single-environment adaptation, making it particularly suitable for multi-environment wireless deployments where operators need to quickly adapt models across diverse propagation conditions.

The consistent performance gains across domain transfers validate LoRA as the preferred parameter-efficient method for practical wireless system deployment, where models must adapt to varying environmental conditions with minimal computational overhead.
